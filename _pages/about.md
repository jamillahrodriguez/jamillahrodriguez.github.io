I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My research revolves around the phonology of indigenous and endangered languages, particularly in Mesoamerica. Most of my fieldwork is with diaspora communities of a languages indigenous to Oaxaca, Mexico. I am especially interested in computational and experimental phonology, as well as the syntax-phonology interface.

Outside of academia, I enjoy tabletop games, knitting and crocheting, and spending time with my family.
