This course is designed to give students experience working in a "fieldwork" setting with a native speaker of an understudied language. We will be working closely with a native speaker consultant to document and analyze various aspects of their grammar. Students present a final project at the end of the semester, which can feature a research paper or a community-centered creative project. <br>
